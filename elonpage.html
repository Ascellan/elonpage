      <h2>Early days</h2>
      <p> Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa.
        As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his
        parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.
      <h2>How he became the big shot</h2>
      <p>Musk has had his hands on many projects, which turned out to be
        huge successes.</p>
        <p>He became a multimillionaire when he sold his start-up company,
          Zip2 to a division of Compaq computers while in his 20s.</p>
        <p>He hasnâ€™t become a successful businessman by accident, though.
          Hard work and taking risks are the hallmarks of the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.
        </p>
      <h2>Elon and Grimes</h2>
      <p>In 2018 Musk discovered a
        joke about artificial intelligence on the singer Grimes' Twitter account. Musk
        reached out to her.
      <p>They had a child in 2020 who has an unconventional name, X AE A-XII.
      </p>
      <p>However, they are now separated.</p>
      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p>
        Elon Musk wants to send humans to Mars. He believes our future is there
        or has to be.
      </p>
      <p>"When something is important enough,
      you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
